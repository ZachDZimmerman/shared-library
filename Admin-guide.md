# Admin Guide

This repository is intended as a starting point for Jenkins administrators, shared services teams, and developers to [inner source](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/inner_source) and collaborate on a common Jenkins shared library.  

Shared libraries provide two main features.

* Allow code reuse between pipeline projects.
* Allow Jenkins admins to expose restricted objects and methods for general use without whitelisting.

This example is for sharing code via shared libaries.  For an example global shared library as a mechanism for avoiding whitelisting refer to [TBD](#).
